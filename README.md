# autocommandsender
I Maded a plugin thats automaticly sends a command which you want by using config. you can change command prompt on config like "mp load FullMap" "bc &lt;(rich)>(anything)" "say hi" "@(anything)" and EVERYTING YOU CAN COMMAND. So you ask "did you do from ai?" No. i didn't thats my FIRST NOT MADED AI PLUGIN (finally can code with not ai)
